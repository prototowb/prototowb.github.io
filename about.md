# About Me

I am a self-taught Web Developer from North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), with a whole lot of struggle in the background. Had to switch perspectives due to worsening of my auto-immune disease, and am now open to remote work/job offers as i delve deeper into the topic of webDev! :-) 

## What is the ProtoHub?

Well, it actually startet as place for storing notes and stuff (on a separate discord server). Over time it evolved to the Idea of a Tech-Blog with the Discord Community as Synergie, and ist still in the making. I actually trying to lay a foundation by participating in the #100daysOfCode challenge.
